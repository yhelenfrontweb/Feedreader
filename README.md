## About

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass. Feed Reader Testing is a part of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program by Udacity.
